# EHR-based Stratification of Hypertension Patients by Integration of Genetic Variants
This project proposes a multi-modal deep representation learning model, which extracts latent feature vectors from high-dimensional EHR and genetic data. On top of it, we perform the K-means clustering to derive hypertension subtypes.

The project is structured as follows:
